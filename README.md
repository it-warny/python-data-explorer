üöÄ About The Project
Welcome to the Python Data Explorer! This tool was developed as a key portfolio project to showcase foundational data science skills. It addresses a common and crucial task for any data professional: performing an initial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

Instead of manually writing the same code to inspect every new dataset, this script automates the process, providing a comprehensive overview of any CSV file in seconds. It's a practical demonstration of leveraging Python for efficiency and data-driven insights.

üõ†Ô∏è Built With
This project was built using the core libraries of the Python Data Science ecosystem:

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

üèÅ Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone [https://github.com/it-warny/python-data-explorer.git](https://github.com/it-warny/python-data-explorer.git)

Navigate to the project directory:

cd python-data-explorer

Install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

üíª Usage Example
Run the script from your terminal:

python data_explorer.py

When prompted, enter the full path to the CSV file you want to analyze.

The script will print the analysis directly to your terminal and save the generated graphs in a new analysis_plots folder in the same directory.
